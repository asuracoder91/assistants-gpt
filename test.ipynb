       "'{\"result\": \"Wikipedia Result\\\\n\\\\n대왕판다(大王판다, 문화어: 참대곰, giant panda, 중국어:大熊猫, 학명: Ailuropoda melanoleuca)는 중국 쓰촨성 지방과 티베트의 고산 지대에 서식하는 곰과 포유동물이다. 자이언트판다, 자이언트를 생략하고 판다라고 하기도 하고 왕판다라고도 한다. 영어식 발음으로 팬더라고도 하나, 표준어로 인정하는 표기는 판다이다. 영어권에서 쓰는 이름인 ‘giant panda’는 애기판다처럼 대나무잎을 먹는 큰 동물이라는 점 때문에 붙였다. 중국어에서 애기판다를 작은 대왕판다라는 뜻의 ‘샤오슝마오(중국어: 小熊猫 ‘소웅묘’[*])’라고 부른다. 대한민국에서는 자생하지는 않으나 동물원에 4마리가 있다.\\\\n천적은 눈표범, 자칼, 담비다.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== 생태 ==\\\\n큰 덩치, 귀와 눈 주위의 검은 반점으로 눈에 쉽게 띄인다. 식육목에 속하지만, 먹이 99%는 대나무다. 가끔씩 야생 판다는 다른 식물이나 육류를 섭취하기도 한다.\\\\n대왕 판다는 주로 쓰촨성 지방의 산간 지역에 서식하고, 산시성과 간쑤성에도 서식한다.\\\\n개간, 벌채 등의 인간 활동으로 판다 서식지가 매년 줄어든다.\\\\n판다는 멸종위기종이었다. 2007년, 중국과 다른 27개의 국가에서 239마리를 사육하였고 (야생 판다 개체 수는 자료마다 다르다. 어떤 곳은 1,590마리 로 추산하는 반면, 2006년 연구에 2,000마리에서 3,000마리 가량이라는 결과가 있다.) 또, 개체 수가 증가 추세라는 보고도 있다. 그러나 IUCN은 등급을 격하할 만큼 충분하지는 않다고 하였으나 2016년 9월 4일 IUCN은 2014년 성체 기준 1864마리로 증가했으므로 멸종위기종에서 멸종취약종으로 멸종위기등급을 한 단계 낮추었다.\\\\n세계자연기금의 상징이다. 보통 중국내에서 중국을 상징하는 동물은 용이지만, 국제적으로 판다가 대표한다. 그 예로 2008년 하계 올림픽 마스코트인 푸와가 있으며, 1990년 아시안 게임 마스코트 역시 판다였다. 20세기 후반 즈음에 중국 동전 도안으로 사용했다. 대한민국 용인에버랜드에서 대왕판다를 사육하며, 국내에 사육하는 판다류는 레서판다로 서울대공원에서 사육한다. 조선민주주의인민공화국에서는 평양동물원에서 여러 마리를 사육한 적이 있다.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== 판다의 몸 ==\\\\n 판다는 검은색과 흰색 털로 몸 색깔을 이룬다. 성체 몸 길이는 꼬리 길이를 포함하여 1.2 ~ 1.8 m이다. 수컷은 몸무게가 160 kg까지 나간다. 암컷은 보통, 수컷보다 10 ~ 20% 정도 작으며, 몸무게는 75 kg 정도이나, 125 kg까지 나가기도 한다. 성체 평균 몸무게는 100 ~ 115 kg이다.\\\\n체형은 다른 곰과 비슷하며, 귀, 눈두덩, 입, 다리, 팔, 어깨 부분은 검은 털, 나머지 부분은 흰 털이다. 왜 이런 색인지 아직 불분명하지만 눈이 내리고, 바위가 많은 환경에서 보호색 역할을 한다고 추정한다. 가죽은 두껍고, 촘촘한 털로 체온을 유지한다. 큰 어금니와 강한 턱 근육으로 대나무를 씹어 먹는다.\\\\n앞발에는 5개 발가락 이외에 가짜 \\\\\"엄지\\\\\"로 부르는, 종자골이 변한 뼈가 있다. 이 뼈는 대나무를 먹는 동안, 대나무를 쥐는 역할을 한다. 스티븐 제이 굴드는 판다의 가짜 엄지에 대해 써서 《판다의 엄지》라는 제목의 책을 출판했다. 꼬리 길이는 10 ~ 15 cm로 곰과 동물 중에서 두 번째로 길다. 덧붙여, 꼬리가 가장 긴 곰은 느림보곰이다.\\\\n수명은, 야생에서는 20년, 사육 상태에서는 최대 30년이다. 기록 상으로 사육 상태에서 가장 오래 살았던 판다는 암컷, 밍밍(Ming Ming)으로 34살까지 살았다.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== 습성 ==\\\\n일생 대부분을 어슬렁거리거나 대나무 숲에서 먹으면서 시간을 보낸다. 혼자 있기를 좋아해서 각자 자신만의 영역이 있다. 특히, 암컷은 자신의 영역에 다른 암컷이 들어오는 것을 꺼려한다. 판다는 소리를 내거나, 나무에 발톱 자국이나 소변을 보는 방법 등으로 의사소통을 한다. 나무에 기어오르기도 해서 속이 빈 나무나 바위 틈을 보금자리로 삼기도 하지만 한 곳에 오래 머무르지는 않는다. 이 때문에, 겨울잠이 없다. 겨울이면 겨울잠 대신 더욱 따뜻한 높은 곳으로 이동한다. 주로 시각 기억보다 공간 기억에 의존한다.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== 생식 ===\\\\n다른 개체와 교류는 주로, 가까운 곳에 있는 판다들이 하나둘 모이는 번식기에 나타난다. 짝짓기가 끝나면 수컷은 암컷 홀로 새끼를 기르게 하고 떠난다.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== 성격 ===\\\\n보통, 판다가 온순하다고 생각하나, 사실은 사람을 공격하기도 한다. 이는 포식 활동이 아니라 스트레스를 해소하는 행동으로 본다.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== 먹이 ===\\\\n\\\\n분류학적으로는 식육목이나, 주로 채식을 하며 대부분이 대나무이다. 그러나 소화계는 식육목과 같고, 유전자도 식육목에 속하며, 대나무를 섭취해도 약간의 에너지와 단백질밖에 얻지 못한다. 섬유소 소화는 장 내의 미생물이 담당한다. 독특한 적응성으로 대나무 숲에서 수백만 년 동안 살았으며, 대나무를 먹고 소화하는 적응력이 대나무 숲 서식으로 특화하였다. 하루에 평균 9 ~ 14 kg의 대나무를 먹는다. 이는 영양분이 적어서, 양으로 소화계를 활성해야 하기 때문이다. 결국, 대나무를 먹어서 얻는 적은 양의 에너지가 판다 습성에 영향을 주었다. 이 때문에, 판다는 다른 개체와 교류를 줄이고, 올라가야 하는 경사진 곳을 기피한다.\\\\n판다는 두 가지 두드러진 특징이 있는데, 하나는 큰 몸집과 다른 하나는 둥근 얼굴로, 대나무를 먹는 식성에 적응한 결과다. 판다 연구가 러셀 치오촌은 판다는 채식을 하는 고릴라와 유사하게 부피 당 표면적이 낮아서 신진대사율이 낮고 그다지 움직이지 않는 생활 덕분에 적은 영양분으로 살아간다고 확인했다. 마찬가지로, 둥근 얼굴은 단단한 대나무를 씹는 턱 근육이 발달하여 생긴 결과이다.\\\\n야생에서 25종의 대나무를 먹는다. 판다가 서식하는 높은 지대에는 대나무 몇 종만이 넓게 퍼져 있다. 대나무는 단백질 레벨이 가장 높다(줄기 부분은 조금 덜하다). 하루에 최대 40회까지 배변을 보기도 한다.\\\\n대나무 종 사이의 특징(꽃이 피는 시기, 지는 시기 등)이 다르므로 판다 서식지 주변에 최소한 2종의 대나무가 있어야 굶주리지 않는다. 초식이라고 해도 여전히 곰 이빨은 확실히 남아서, 필요하면 육류, 생선 등의 먹이도 먹는다. 사육 상태에서 대부분 대나무를 먹이로 주고, 가끔 가공한 과자나 과일, 채소 등 다른 먹이를 주기도 한다.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== 유전체학 ==\\\\n2009년, 판다의 게놈의 배열 순서를 차세대 염기서열 분석법을 이용하여 밝혔다. 20쌍의 상염색체와 1쌍의 성염색체로 이루어져 있다.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== 분류 및 진화 ==\\\\n판다는 곰과 너구리의 특징을 공유해서 분류학에서 정확한 유전 위치를 수십 년 동안 논의하였다. 그러나 분자유전학 연구로, 곰과의 주 가지에서 분화하였지만 여전히 곰과에 속한다고 결론을 내었다. 현재, 안경곰이 판다와 가장 근연 관계가 깊다. 살아있는 화석으로 여겨긴다.\\\\n레서판다와 이름이 비슷하고 서식지, 먹이는 물론이고 가짜 \\\\\"엄지\\\\\"도 같지만, 근연 관계는 아니다. 레서판다는 \\'곰과\\'가 아니라 \\'족제비상과\\' 족제비, 아메리카 너구리와 근연 관계인 레서판다과에 속한다.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== 아종 ===\\\\n여러 가지 특징을 기초로 연구한 결과, 2종의 아종을 확인했다.\\\\n\\\\nAiluropoda melanoleuca melanoleuca\\\\n주 종으로 현존하는 판다 대부분이 속한다. 주로 쓰촨성에서 서식하며 검은색과 흰색의 대비를 보인다.\\\\n\\\\nAiluropoda melanoleuca qinlingensis(친링 판다)\\\\n친링산맥에서만 서식한다. 암갈색과 연갈색의 대비를 보인다. 주 종보다 몸집은 작고, 어금니는 크다.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== 인간과의 관계 ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== 옛 문헌 ===\\\\n과거에는 고귀한 생물로 여겼다. 전한 문제 모후인 박태후를 죽은 뒤에 판다 두개골과 함께 묻었다. 당 태종 손자는 우호의 표시로 두 마리 판다와 가죽을 일본에 보냈다고 전한다. 고대 중국에서 다른 동물들과 달리 의학적인 용도로는 좀처럼 사용하지 않았으나, 쓰촨 성 사람들은 우연히 삼킨 바늘을 녹이려고 판다의 소변을 이용하고 월경을 제어하려고 생가죽을 이용했다고 진나라 때 사전 이아에 기록이 있다.\\\\n여러 고서에는 \\\\\"맥(貘)\\\\\"이라고 언급했다. 후한 때 한자 사전 \\\\n\\\\n스즈모토 유이치(일본어: 涼元 悠一, 1969년 1월 13일 ~ )는 일본인 소설가로서 일본 시즈오카현 시미즈정에서 태어나 현재는 일본 오사카부에 살고 있다. 그는 2006년부터 Leaf로 알려진 유통사 Aquaplus에서 일하고 있는데, Leaf로 이직 전 그는 비주얼 아트의 시나리오 라이터로 여러 소속 브랜드들에서 일했다. 그의 주목할 만한 저작으로는 Key의 비주얼 노벨 《Air》, 《클라나드》, 《플라네타리안 ~자그마한 별의 꿈~》이 있다.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== 경력 ==\\\\n현립 시즈오카 시미즈 동고를 졸업한 스즈모토는 그가 집필한 《우리들 청춘의 북서벽(일본어: 我が青春の北西壁)》으로 1991년 제16회 슈에이샤 코발트 소설 대상에서 최우수상을 받았다. 1993년 3월, 슈에이샤는 스즈모토의 소설인 《그녀석은 민들레(일본어: あいつはダンディー・ライオン)》를 《코발트 문고》 시리즈로 출간했다. 1998년, 스즈모토의 소설인 《푸른 고양이의 마을(일본어: 青猫の街)》이 제10회 일본 판타지 소설 대상에서 2등에 올랐다. 1999년, Key는 그들의 첫 번째 비주얼 노벨인 카논을 발매하는데, 여기에 깊은 감동을 받은 스즈모토는 Key를 하위에 두고있는 유통사인 비주얼 아트에 입사해 2000년 2월부터 비주얼 아트의 시나리오 라이터로써 여러 브랜드에서 활동하기 시작했다.\\\\n스즈모토의 첫 번째 참가작품은 2000년 Key가 2번째로 발매한 《Air》로써 그해에 Giant Panda의 《엄마아빠 조교》에 시나리오 어시스턴트로 동시에 참가했다. 2001년, 그는 또다시 Giant Panda의 《첫날밤 헌상》의 시나리오 어시스턴트로 참가함과 동시에 2004년까지 발매되지 않았던 Key의 차기작, 《클라나드》의 작업에 참가했다. 그와 동시에 2001년, 스즈모토는 Words에 시나리오 어시스트로 고용되어 2002년 발매된 《벚나무 아래에서》의 작업과 2003년 스튜디오 Mebius에서 발매된 《Snow》의 작업에 참가했다. 같은해, 스즈모토는 Giant Panda의 2004년에 발매된 《스토킹 공주》에 시나리오 어시스트로 참가했다. 《클라나드》에서 자신의 담당부분을 끝낸 그는 2004년에 발매된 Key에서의 마지막 작품, 《플라네타리안 ~자그마한 별의 꿈~》의 메인 시나리오 라이터로 참가한다. 그 후 그는 2005년 9월 회사를 그만둘 때까지 비주얼 아트에서 활동했다. 1년 뒤인 2006년 6월, 스즈모토는 Leaf로 알려진 유통사 Aquaplus에 취직했으며, 2006년 12월에는 스즈모토의 첫 라이트 노벨 《Die Nachtjäger》를 출판사 소프트 뱅크의 《GA 문고》 시리즈로 출판했다.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== 각주 ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== 외부 링크 ==\\\\n(일본어) 스즈모토 유이치의 개인

Key와 비주얼 아트를 그만두었다. 그는 현재까지도 다른 비주얼 노벨 개발사들과 작업해 오고 있다.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== 경력 ==\\\\n도고시 마고메는 2000년 Key의 두 번째 작품인 《Air》를 기점으로 작곡가로써 활동하기 시작했는데, 《Air》와 그 OST의 성공으로 도고시는 비주얼 노벨 매니아들에게 잘 알려졌다. 2001년, 그는 제작이 시작된 Key의 차기작 《클라나드》와 비주얼 아트 산하의 다른 브랜드들에서 작곡을 했는데, 거기에는 지금은 없어진 브랜드 Words에서 2002년에 발매된 《벚나무 아래에서》와 2003년 발매된 Bonbee!의 《ALMA~쭉 곁에서...~》가 있다. 2004년 《클라나드》가 발매되자, 도고시는 Giant Panda에서 《스토킹 공주》와 《Maiden Halo》의 작곡작업과 Key의 4번째 작품인 《플라네타리안 ~자그마한 별의 꿈~》의 모든 음악을 작곡했다. 다음해인 2005년, 도고시는 Key의 5번째 작품인 《토모요 애프터 ~It\\'s a wonderful life~》의 작곡작업에 참여했다. 2006년, 그는 다시 한번 Giant Panda를 도와 《두사람이서 하나의 연정》의 작곡작업에 참여함과 동시에 Key의 6번째 작품인 《리틀 버스터즈!》의 제작에 참여했다. 그가 작곡하거나 어레인지한 곡들은 Key의 레이블인 Key Sounds Label로 발매되었다. 2006년 10월, 《리틀 버스터즈!》의 제작이 한창일 때 그는 Key와 비주얼 아트를 떠났다. 그 뒤, 도고시는 ALcot의 2007년 발매된 비주얼 노벨인 《FairChild》의 작곡작업에 참여했으며, Ram의 2008년 발매된 비주얼 노벨인 《5》의 엔딩 테마곡을 작곡했다.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== 각주 ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== 외부 링크 ==\\\\n(일본어) 도고시 마고메의 개인 웹사이트 Archived 2008년 6월 25일 - 웨이백 머신 \\\\n\\\\n\"}'"

Round black ears and black eye patches stand out against a white face and neck. Black limbs, tail, legs, and shoulders contrast with the white torso. The rear paws point inward, which gives pandas a waddling gait. Pandas can easily stand on their hind legs and are commonly observed somersaulting, rolling, and dust-bathing. Although somewhat awkward as climbers, pandas readily ascend trees and, on the basis of their resemblance to bears, are probably capable of swimming. An unusual anatomic characteristic is an enlarged \\\\nwrist\\\\n bone that functions somewhat like a thumb, enabling pandas to handle food with considerable \\\\ndexterity\\\\n.\\\\n \\\\nNatural history\\\\n \\\\ngiant panda (\\\\nAiluropoda melanoleuca\\\\n)\\\\nGiant panda (\\\\nAiluropoda melanoleuca\\\\n) eating bamboo.\\\\n(more)\\\\ngiant panda\\\\nGiant panda (\\\\nAiluropoda melanoleuca\\\\n) feeding on bamboo.\\\\n(more)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBritannica Quiz\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAnimal Group Names\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAs much as 90\\\\u201398 percent of the \\\\npanda\\\\u2019s\\\\n diet consists of the leaves, shoots, and stems of \\\\nbamboo\\\\n, a large grass available year-round in much of China\\\\u2019s forested regions. Despite \\\\nadaptations\\\\n in the forepaws, teeth, and jaws for bamboo \\\\nconsumption\\\\n, the giant panda has retained the \\\\ndigestive system\\\\n of its \\\\ncarnivore\\\\n ancestry and is therefore unable to digest \\\\ncellulose\\\\n, a main \\\\nconstituent\\\\n of bamboo. Pandas solve this problem by rapidly passing prodigious quantities of the grass through their digestive tracts on a daily basis. As much as 16 out of every 24 hours is spent feeding, and elimination of wastes occurs up to 50 times per day. Fossilized dental remains indicate that the giant panda committed to bamboo as its principal food source at least three million years ago. Although unable to capture prey, pandas retain a taste for meat, which is used as bait to capture them for radio collaring and has made them pests in human camps on occasion. The species cannot naturally survive outside bamboo forests, though in captivity they have been maintained on cereals, milk, and garden fruits and vegetables. Bamboo is the healthier diet for captive pandas.\\\\n \\\\npanda sleeping\\\\nA sleeping giant panda (\\\\nAiluropoda melanoleuca\\\\n) at a breeding centre in Chengdu, Sichuan province, China. \\\\n(more)\\\\nThe giant panda\\\\u2019s \\\\nsolitary\\\\n nature is underscored by its reliance on its sense of \\\\nsmell\\\\n (olfaction). Each \\\\nanimal\\\\n confines its activities to a range of about 4 to 6 square km (1.5 to 2.3 square miles), but these home ranges often overlap substantially. Under this arrangement scent functions in regulating contact between individuals. A large scent gland located just below the tail and surrounding the anus is used to leave olfactory messages for other pandas. The gland is rubbed against trees, rocks, and clumps of grass, with scent conveying information on identity, sex, and possibly \\\\nsocial status\\\\n of the marking individual. Chemical analysis of marks is consistent with a difference in function for males and females. Males appear to use scent to identify the areas where they live, whereas females primarily use it for signaling \\\\nestrus\\\\n. Except for the mothers\\\\u2019 care of infants, the only social activity of pandas takes place during females\\\\u2019 estrus, which occurs annually during the spring and lasts one to three days. A spring mating season (March\\\\u2013May) and a fall birth season (August\\\\u2013September) are seen in both wild and captive populations. Males appear to locate females first by scent and ultimately by vocalizations. Assemblages of one to five males per female have been recorded. At this time males may become highly aggressive as they compete for the opportunity to mate.\\\\n \\\\ngiant panda cub (\\\\nAiluropoda melanoleuca\\\\n)\\\\nGiant panda cub (\\\\nAiluropoda melanoleuca\\\\n) sleeping on a branch.\\\\n(more)\\\\nLike \\\\nbears\\\\n, giant pandas undergo a \\\\ndelay in implantation\\\\n of the fertilized ovum into the wall of the uterus, a period of two to three months after mating. Hormone levels in females\\\\u2019 urine indicate that the period of embryonic/fetal growth and development lasts only about two months. Altogether, \\\\ngestation\\\\n averages 135 days (with a range of 90\\\\u2013184 days), but, because of the short growth phase, a term \\\\nfetus\\\\n weighs only about 112 grams (4 ounces) on average. Relative to the mother, giant pandas produce the smallest offspring of any \\\\nplacental mammal\\\\n (about 1/800 of the mother\\\\u2019s weight). For the first two to three weeks of life, the mother uses her forepaws and her thumblike wrist bones to cuddle and position the infant against herself in a rather uncarnivore-like and almost human fashion. Nearly half of the 133 captive births recorded before 1998 were of \\\\ntwins\\\\n, but panda mothers are typically unable to care for more than one infant. Reasons for the extremely small size of the offspring and the frequent production of twins are not understood, but both are traits shared with bears.\\\\n \\\\nThe newborn panda is blind and covered with only a thin all-white coat. It is virtually helpless, being able only to suckle and vocalize. It depends on its mother for warmth, nourishment, positioning at the breast, and stimulating the passage of wastes. Development is slow during the early months. Eyes begin to open at about 45 days, and the first wobbly steps are taken at 75\\\\u201380 days. Its helpless state \\\\nmandates\\\\n birth in a den, an \\\\nenvironment\\\\n in which it lives for the first 100\\\\u2013120 days of life. By about 14 months, at which age the milk teeth have erupted, the infant readily consumes bamboo, and at 18\\\\u201324 months weaning from the mother takes place. Separation from the mother must occur before a female can undertake the production of her next litter. Captive pandas may live beyond 30 years in captivity, but life span in the wild is estimated at about 20 years.\\\\n \\\\nConservation and classification\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGet Unlimited Access\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTry Britannica Premium for free and discover more.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSubscribe\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFossils from northern \\\\nMyanmar\\\\n and \\\\nVietnam\\\\n and much of China as far north as \\\\nBeijing\\\\n indicate that the giant panda was widely distributed throughout eastern Asia during the early \\\\nPleistocene Epoch\\\\n (2.6 million to 11,700 years ago). Human \\\\ndestruction\\\\n of its forest habitat, \\\\ncombined\\\\n with \\\\npoaching\\\\n, has restricted the species to remote fragments of mountain habitat along the eastern edge of the \\\\nTibetan Plateau\\\\n in the Chinese provinces of \\\\nSichuan (Szechwan)\\\\n, \\\\nShaanxi (Shensi)\\\\n, and \\\\nGansu (Kansu)\\\\n. The total area of these habitats is about 13,000 square km (5,000 square miles), and in recent times periodic mass flowering and die-offs of bamboo have brought starvation for some populations. (Five to 10 years are required for bamboo forests to recover from these natural events.) Since the 1990s China has greatly expanded its conservation efforts, and it now regards the panda as a national treasure. The reserve system has been expanded from 14 sites to more than 40, and cooperative international arrangements were \\\\nimplemented\\\\n to provide training in reserve management and captive \\\\nbreeding\\\\n. The panda had long been considered an \\\\nendangered species\\\\n by the IUCN, but the environmental organization changed the status of the panda to \\\\u201c\\\\nvulnerable\\\\n\\\\u201d in 2016, because of China\\\\u2019s success in restoring bamboo forest habitat.\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPrior eras of giving pandas as gifts and of short-term commercial loans to zoos have given way to lending agreements that generate funds for preservation of the wild population. More than 120 pandas are maintained in captivity in China, and another 15 to 20 are found in zoos elsewhere. Captive populations are increasing. \\\\nSu-Lin, the first of the giant pandas to be exhibited in the West, reached the \\\\nUnited States\\\\n as an infant in 1936 and was a popular attraction at the \\\\nBrookfield Zoo\\\\n, near Chicago, until its death in 1938. No European observed a live giant panda in the wild until the Walter St\\\\u00f6tzner \\\\nexpedition\\\\n of 1913\\\\u201315, although \\\\nArmand David\\\\n, a \\\\nVincentian\\\\n missionary, discovered some panda furs in 1869.\\\\n \\\\nThe \\\\nclassification\\\\n of giant pandas has long been a subject of controversy. Anatomic, behavioral, and biochemical data have been used to place pandas with \\\\nbear\\\\ns (family Ursidae), with \\\\nraccoon\\\\ns (Procyonidae), or in a family of their own (Ailuridae). Improved molecular analyses made during the 1990s strongly suggest bears as the giant panda\\\\u2019s closest relatives, and many of their behavioral and reproductive characteristics are consistent with this placement.\\\\nDonald G.
